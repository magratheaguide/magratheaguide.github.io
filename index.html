			<h1>Magrathea</h1>

			<p>
				Open source coding resources for play-by-post roleplaying sites.
			</p>

			<aside>
				<p>
					We're updating this site in the open. Thanks for your
					patience while we remodel!
				</p>

				<p>
					Curious to watch the progress in detail? You can view and
					follow along with
					<a
						href="https://github.com/magratheaguide/magratheaguide.github.io"
						>this site's code on GitHub</a
					>.
				</p>
			</aside>

			<h2>What is Magrathea?</h2>

			<p>
				<b>Play-by-post roleplaying (RP) sites are about writing.</b>
				And, tangentially, they’re about code. RP sites can function
				just fine with the default code hosts provide, but we want these
				spaces to feel welcoming and homey, thematic and inspiring, we
				want them to be places we’re eager to cozy up in, sometimes as
				often as daily. But we’re writers, first and foremost, and these
				are writing spaces. How can we get what we seek out of code and
				also keep it out of the way as much as possible so we can focus
				on what we’re really here to do?
			</p>

			<p>
				Magrathea is meant to be one possible answer to that question.
				It’s a collection of resources, and an offer of help. It’s an
				effort to make creating, maintaining, and participating in RP
				sites easier and more accessible. It’s a way to give back to our
				very unique and special community. And it won’t cost you any
				money.
			</p>

			<h2>What Does Magrathea Offer?</h2>

			<p>
				So what does Magrathea offer? Broadly speaking, free, high
				quality, open source code. But that’s an extremely brief way to
				say a whole lot, so let’s break it down.
			</p>

			<h3>Free And Open Source</h3>

			<p>
				The resources provided through Magrathea don't cost you any
				money. There are some terms you'll need to follow, but
				Magrathea’s publicly available projects exclusively fall under
				open source licenses, whose terms are meant to be
				straightforward and to benefit creators and communities. In
				fact,
				<strong
					>the terms of most Magrathea projects are as simple as
					providing credit</strong
				>. You can get full details for any specific Magrathea project
				from its associated license file.
			</p>

			<aside>
				<h4>What is "open source?"</h4>

				<p>
					If you've never heard of "open source" before, GitHub
					provides a few helpful resources. Their "Open Source Guides"
					offer a
					<a
						href="https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/#what-does-open-source-mean"
						>definition of "open source"</a
					>
					and the "Choose a License" site contains a high-level
					<a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/"
						>summary of popular open source licenses</a
					>.
				</p>
			</aside>

			<h3>High Quality Code</h3>

			<p>
				"High quality code" here means code that tries its darnedest to
				be both <i>approachable</i> and <i>accessible</i>.
			</p>

			<h4>What is Approachable Code?</h4>

			<div>
				<p>Approachable code is code that is:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Readable</b>, favoring clarity over concision by, for
						example, avoiding acronyms and shorthand
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Organized</b> in a considered and consistent way that
						includes clear names and structure
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Well-documented</b> inline where possible and with
						supplemental documentation as needed
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Easily maintained</b>. Someone trying to fix a bug or
						make an update in the code should be able to understand
						the ripple effects of doing so
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Built on modern standards</b>, and so is free of
						outdated, deprecated, or obsolete ways of doing things
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Something others can learn from</b> or make use of in
						ways that jumpstart or simplify their own efforts
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<h4>What is Accessible Code?</h4>

			<div>
				<p>
					Anybody who wants to write should be able to participate in
					our community regardless of the ways they need or want to
					approach our sites. From a coding standpoint, that kind of
					inclusivity doesn’t just magically happen, it’s something we
					need to actively think about and support. When we write
					code, we have the power and responsibility to respect the
					myriad ways that people choose to or must use technology.
					That, for a few non-exhaustive examples, means coding for
					people who:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Use screen readers or other assistive devices</li>
					<li>Use the keyboard to navigate a site</li>
					<li>Use touchscreen devices</li>
					<li>Are negatively affected by excess motion</li>
					<li>Modify their browser's default font size</li>
					<li>Swap out their browser's default font</li>
					<li>Zoom in on sites</li>
					<li>Have difficulty differentiating between colors</li>
					<li>Have sun shining on and washing out their screen</li>
					<li>
						Lower their screen's brightness, or shift its colors
					</li>
					<li>Become lost within or between pages</li>
					<li>Have difficulty interacting with small targets</li>
					<li>Have slower or lower bandwidth internet connections</li>
					<li>
						Use devices whose screens are different sizes or
						resolutions
					</li>
					<li>
						Want to or prefer to use languages other than English,
						which may be written in different directions
					</li>
					<li>
						Have accessibility needs or desires that change over
						time or in specific contexts (which is <em>all</em> of
						us!)
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					(For a more eloquent list than this, check out
					<a href="https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org"
						>Inclusive Design Principles</a
					>.)
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				The code provided through Magrathea likely won't be perfectly
				accessible always, but we want it to be! We're committed to
				doing the best we can and learning from our shortcomings (so
				please do reach out if you see something that could be better!).
			</p>

			<hr />

			<p>
				Writing code that’s approachable and accessible isn’t always
				easy, but if we keep it in mind upfront and throughout the
				process, we can hopefully remove a lot of friction for a lot of
				folks on a lot of fronts.
			</p>

			<h2>What Resources Are Currently Available?</h2>

			<p>
				All available Magrathea codes live as
				<a href="https://github.com/magratheaguide/"
					>repositories on GitHub under the Magrathea organization</a
				>. Only a few callouts will be featured here.
			</p>

			<aside>
				If you’re not familiar with GitHub, there are a lot of great
				learning resources out there, including
				<a href="https://help.github.com/en/github"
					>GitHub’s own documentation</a
				>
				and
				<a
					href="https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github"
					>Learning Lab</a
				>.
			</aside>

			<p>
				As part of Magrathea, we also take on commissions to build out
				complete custom themes. You can find the commission terms later
				on this page.
			</p>

			<hgroup>
				<h3>Vogsphere</h3>

				<p>The Claim Code Generator</p>
			</hgroup>

			<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/magratheaguide/vogsphere"
					>Vogsphere</a
				>
				is a tool that enables you to create a claims form on your site.
				Instead of editing code, your members can just fill out that
				form to generate exactly what they need to post to make their
				claims. No more code typos for you to deal with, no more trying
				to sift through code for them. Win-win.
			</p>

			<ul class="feature-icons">
				<li class="icon solid fa-code">

					<a
						href="https://magrathea.guide/vogsphere/dist/vogsphere.html"
						>Try the Vogsphere demo</a
					>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>How Do Custom Commissions Work?</h2>

			<p>
				Long story short, Magrathea commissions work a bit differently
				than your typical commission. You pay no money, you're asked to
				provide the graphics, and the whole thing comes with a
				community-contributing twist:
				<strong
					>We donate the full theme (minus the graphics) to the
					community when you’re not using it anymore for the site it
					was made for</strong
				>.
			</p>

			<p>And as for the long story...</p>

			<h3>You Get</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>You get</b> a complete, custom theme<sup
						><a
							href="#footnote-1"
							id="footnote-1-source"
							>[1]</a
						></sup
					>
					for your site (which can be on any forum host<sup
						><a
							href="#footnote-2"
							id="footnote-2-source"
							>[2]</a
						></sup
					>) and it's coded in an approachable and accessible way
					<ul>
						<li>
							Includes all member templates (posting, comm, dev,
							requests, etc.)
						</li>
						<li>
							Includes all admin templates (announcements, claims,
							member directory, etc.)
						</li>
						<li>Includes application and shipper templates</li>
						<li>
							Includes the guidebook (rules, setting, member
							groups, etc.)
						</li>
						<li>
							Includes elements that change based on member group
						</li>
						<li>
							Includes whatever else you might need coded. Let us
							know what you’re looking for!
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>You get</b> installation and configuration of the code
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>You get</b> ongoing support, in case, for example, you
					ever run across a bug that needs fixing or a need a new
					template
				</li>
			</ul>

			<section>
				<p>
					<a
						href="#footnote-1-source"
						id="footnote-1"
						>[1]</a
					>
					If you come from the Jcink subset of the community, you’re
					probably more familiar with the term "skin." Though they
					mean the same thing, we use "theme" here instead because
					it's the more broadly used term in the overall tech
					industry, and because "skin" quickly becomes inappropriate
					and unacceptable in conversation (such as when discussing,
					comparing, or stating preferences for "light skins" versus
					"dark skins" or as used in the phrase "skinning a site,"
					yikes). The terms we use come with meaning and context, and
					sensitivity is important.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>
					<a
						href="#footnote-2-source"
						id="footnote-2"
						>[2]</a
					>
					While we do accept commissions for any forum host, please
					know that we only have experience with Jcink. We’re fully
					capable of and happy to learn how to build themes for others
					hosts, but that extra bit of learning will make the
					commission take more time. Thanks for your patience!
				</p>
			</section>

			<h3>You Have the Option</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>You have the option</b> to access the code at all times
					(via GitHub), even while it’s under development
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>You have the option</b> to provide feedback whenever.
					We’d love to hear what you think early and often!
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>You have the option</b> to choose which areas of code get
					worked on next
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>You Provide</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>You provide</b> your thoughts, wishes, and feedback! This
					theme will be made to your specs, with input from us on
					keeping it accessible
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong
						><b>You provide</b> the graphics and images. This
						includes things like backgrounds and staff
						avatars</strong
					>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>We Can Discuss Who Provides</h3>

			<ul>
				<li><b>We can discuss who provides</b> fonts</li>
				<li><b>We can discuss who provides</b> icons</li>
				<li>
					<b>We can discuss who provides</b> the color palette. We’ll
					work with you here, too, to make any necessary tweaks for
					better accessibility
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>We Agree</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong
							><b>We agree</b> that when the site closes, becomes
							inactive, or moves on to a different theme,
							Magrathea crew will make the complete theme (minus
							any graphics, fonts, or icons you provided) freely
							available under an open source license to anybody
							who wants to use it, learn from it, modify it,
							whatever.</strong
						>
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong
							>This means the theme is exclusive to your site
							while your site’s around and then afterward becomes
							a donation that contributes to the wider
							community.</strong
						>
					</p>

					<div>
						<p>
							Examples of "closes or becomes inactive" include
							such situations as:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The site hasn’t opened yet, but development on
								it has stopped. We haven’t heard from you in
								over 30 days or you have explicitly said that
								the site won’t open or has in some way been
								shelved
							</li>
							<li>
								The site was open, but there have been no
								in-character or plotting posts in over 30 days
							</li>
							<li>
								The site was open, but you’ve since taken the
								board offline or announced that it will be
								closing
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>We agree</b> to give each other and any supplemental
					resources we use due credit
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>We agree</b> to respect the licenses of any supplemental
					resources we use. This can include anything from fonts to
					bits of functionality
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>We agree</b> that either party can opt out of the
					project. We'll all let each other know what's going on and
					we'll all get to keep a copy of whatever code's already been
					completed to do with as we will
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>You Can</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>You can</b> make any edits you want to
						<em>your own copy</em> of the code
					</p>

					<p>
						Please note, if you instead choose to add code changes
						to the project's Magrathea GitHub repository
						specifically, those changes will all be included in the
						open source version later on. You will, however, be
						given credit for your contribution
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>You can</b> use the theme for any site you wish. The
					theme itself will still be created for one site in
					particular, and that one site is what counts for determining
					when to make the theme publicly available
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Magrathea Can</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Magrathea can</b> complete any unfinished theme to offer
					as an open source resource. This could happen if, for
					example, the site it was originally intended for becomes
					inactive in development
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Magrathea can</b> make a cancelled, unfinished theme
					publicly available as an open source resource as is, without
					finishing it. (Graphics, fonts, and icons you provided will
					still be removed before this happens)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Commissions Status</h2>

			<p>Commissions are currently closed.</p>

			<h2>FAQ</h2>

			<dl>
				<dt>Why don't you provide graphics in custom commissions?</dt>

				<dd>
					<p>
						Graphics manipulation is not a Magrathea specialty.
						Offering <em>high quality</em> resources is an important
						part of Magrathea for us and, since graphics really
						aren't in our wheelhouse, this isn't an area where we
						can confidently meet the standard we've set.
					</p>

					<p>
						That said, we actually see the lack of graphics as a
						benefit overall. It encourages you to put your stamp on
						the theme, and for others to do the same when the theme
						becomes available open source. This is one way that
						future uses of the theme can differentiate themselves
						from each other, so even sites using the same theme feel
						more visually distinct.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Why GitHub?</dt>

				<dd>
					<p>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub"
							>GitHub</a
						>
						is built on top of
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a>, an
						extremely popular distributed version control system
						(a.k.a. means of collaborating on code, each from your
						own computer, in a clean, structured way that tracks all
						changes). GitHub itself provides a way to use Git while
						adding a lot of great features on top. You can search
						for code repositories, know how many people have starred
						that repo, see what’s changed, open a bug or request
						features, manage projects, write wikis for those
						projects, and more. You can even (with respect to the
						repo’s license) branch off your own copy of the code to
						tinker with and use. I use GitHub and Git for Magrathea
						because they’re built to serve exactly this type of
						project and are great at it.
					</p>

					<p>
						And the cherry on top? Open source projects on GitHub
						can accept "<a
							href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests"
							>pull requests</a
						>". This means that anybody who fixes a bug or adds a
						new feature can contribute those changes back to the
						original project, and will automatically and visibly be
						given credit for their contribution. This can be a great
						way to help community resources continue to grow and
						improve. It can also be a great way to learn!
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Does this all mean you’re opposed to paid commissions?</dt>

				<dd>
					<p>
						Not at all! We're well aware of the amount of time,
						thought, energy, and heart that goes into writing code
						for others and we absolutely believe that folks should
						be compensated for their work. We are fortunate enough
						to be in a position where we are able to provide
						resources for free, and we believe doing so actually
						benefits those who offer paid commissions. We believe
						the transparency into the process that we can offer here
						can help non-code savvy folks see just how much work all
						of this actually is, as well as recognize well-written
						code when they see it and better appreciate the value of
						it.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>
					Would you consider taking payment instead to keep a
					commission closed source? Or only making part of it open
					source?
				</dt>

				<dd>
					<p>
						No, sorry. Magrathea is meant to benefit our community
						as much as possible, and doing either of those things
						limits the potential benefits that could be provided.
						There are lots of coders out there that will take on
						commissions under those kind of terms though!
