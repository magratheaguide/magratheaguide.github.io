<h1>{{ eleventyNavigation.key }}</h1>

<p>
	Magrathea includes a collection of tools and scripts meant to help make
	developing and running a play-by-post roleplaying game simpler, or to help
	with various administrative processes.
</p>

<p>
	While the tools themselves live each in their own repository on
	<a href="{{ social.github }}">GitHub</a>, we've here complied a quick
	reference of what's available.
</p>
