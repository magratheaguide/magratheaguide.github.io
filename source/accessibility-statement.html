<p>
	Magrathea and its constituent resources likely wonâ€™t be perfectly
	accessible, inclusive, and usable always, but I want them to be! I use
	semantic HTML, seek to make things usable without JavaScript, and test what
	I create with VoiceOver and across multiple browser engines: Gecko,
	Chromium, and WebKit. I embrace
	<a href="https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/"
		>Inclusive Design Principles</a
	>, strive to meet
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/"
		>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1</a
	>
	at level AA, and am committed to doing the best I can and learning from my
	shortcomings. I recognize that accessibility, inclusivity, and usability are
	not a single destination to stop at but rather an ongoing pursuit, so I
	continuously study and apply what I learn.
</p>

<p>
	If you notice an accessibility, inclusivity, or usability weakness within
	Magrathea and feel up to spending your personal bandwidth to tell me about
	it, please know that I would be most grateful for that gift. Contact methods
	for this, in order of preference, are:
