<h2>How Do Custom Commissions Work?</h2>

<p>
	Long story short, Magrathea commissions work a bit differently than your
	typical commission. You pay no money, you're asked to provide the graphics,
	and the whole thing comes with a community-contributing twist:
	<strong
		>We donate the full theme (minus the graphics) to the community when
		you’re not using it anymore for the site it was made for</strong
	>.
</p>

<p>And as for the long story...</p>

		for your site (which can be on any forum host<sup
			><a
				href="#footnote-2"
				id="footnote-2-source"
				>[2]</a

		If you come from the Jcink subset of the community, you’re probably more
		familiar with the term "skin." Though they mean the same thing, we use
		"theme" here instead because it's the more broadly used term in the
		overall tech industry, and because "skin" quickly becomes inappropriate
		and unacceptable in conversation (such as when discussing, comparing, or
		stating preferences for "light skins" versus "dark skins" or as used in
		the phrase "skinning a site," yikes). The terms we use come with meaning
		and context, and sensitivity is important.

		While we do accept commissions for any forum host, please know that we
		only have experience with Jcink. We’re fully capable of and happy to
		learn how to build themes for others hosts, but that extra bit of
		learning will make the commission take more time. Thanks for your
		patience!

<h3>You Have the Option</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>You have the option</b> to access the code at all times (via GitHub),
		even while it’s under development
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>You have the option</b> to provide feedback whenever. We’d love to
		hear what you think early and often!
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>You have the option</b> to choose which areas of code get worked on
		next
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>You Provide</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>You provide</b> your thoughts, wishes, and feedback! This theme will
		be made to your specs, with input from us on keeping it accessible
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong
			><b>You provide</b> the graphics and images. This includes things
			like backgrounds and staff avatars</strong
		>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>We Can Discuss Who Provides</h3>

<ul>
	<li><b>We can discuss who provides</b> fonts</li>
	<li><b>We can discuss who provides</b> icons</li>
	<li>
		<b>We can discuss who provides</b> the color palette. We’ll work with
		you here, too, to make any necessary tweaks for better accessibility
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>We Agree</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong
				><b>We agree</b> that when the site closes, becomes inactive, or
				moves on to a different theme, Magrathea crew will make the
				complete theme (minus any graphics, fonts, or icons you
				provided) freely available under an open source license to
				anybody who wants to use it, learn from it, modify it,
				whatever.</strong
			>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong
				>This means the theme is exclusive to your site while your
				site’s around and then afterward becomes a donation that
				contributes to the wider community.</strong
			>
		</p>

		<div>
			<p>
				Examples of "closes or becomes inactive" include such situations
				as:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The site hasn’t opened yet, but development on it has
					stopped. We haven’t heard from you in over 30 days or you
					have explicitly said that the site won’t open or has in some
					way been shelved
				</li>
				<li>
					The site was open, but there have been no in-character or
					plotting posts in over 30 days
				</li>
				<li>
					The site was open, but you’ve since taken the board offline
					or announced that it will be closing
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>We agree</b> to give each other and any supplemental resources we use
		due credit
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>We agree</b> to respect the licenses of any supplemental resources we
		use. This can include anything from fonts to bits of functionality
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>We agree</b> that either party can opt out of the project. We'll all
		let each other know what's going on and we'll all get to keep a copy of
		whatever code's already been completed to do with as we will
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>You Can</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			<b>You can</b> make any edits you want to <em>your own copy</em> of
			the code
		</p>

		<p>
			Please note, if you instead choose to add code changes to the
			project's Magrathea GitHub repository specifically, those changes
			will all be included in the open source version later on. You will,
			however, be given credit for your contribution
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>You can</b> use the theme for any site you wish. The theme itself
		will still be created for one site in particular, and that one site is
		what counts for determining when to make the theme publicly available
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Magrathea Can</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Magrathea can</b> complete any unfinished theme to offer as an open
		source resource. This could happen if, for example, the site it was
		originally intended for becomes inactive in development
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Magrathea can</b> make a cancelled, unfinished theme publicly
		available as an open source resource as is, without finishing it.
		(Graphics, fonts, and icons you provided will still be removed before
		this happens)
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<dl>
	<dt>Why don't you provide graphics in custom commissions?</dt>

	<dd>
		<p>
			Graphics manipulation is not a Magrathea specialty. Offering
			<em>high quality</em> resources is an important part of Magrathea
			for us and, since graphics really aren't in our wheelhouse, this
			isn't an area where we can confidently meet the standard we've set.
		</p>

		<p>
			That said, we actually see the lack of graphics as a benefit
			overall. It encourages you to put your stamp on the theme, and for
			others to do the same when the theme becomes available open source.
			This is one way that future uses of the theme can differentiate
			themselves from each other, so even sites using the same theme feel
			more visually distinct.
		</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Why GitHub?</dt>

	<dd>
		<p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a>
			is built on top of
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a>, an extremely
			popular distributed version control system (a.k.a. means of
			collaborating on code, each from your own computer, in a clean,
			structured way that tracks all changes). GitHub itself provides a
			way to use Git while adding a lot of great features on top. You can
			search for code repositories, know how many people have starred that
			repo, see what’s changed, open a bug or request features, manage
			projects, write wikis for those projects, and more. You can even
			(with respect to the repo’s license) branch off your own copy of the
			code to tinker with and use. I use GitHub and Git for Magrathea
			because they’re built to serve exactly this type of project and are
			great at it.
		</p>

		<p>
			And the cherry on top? Open source projects on GitHub can accept "<a
				href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests"
				>pull requests</a
			>". This means that anybody who fixes a bug or adds a new feature
			can contribute those changes back to the original project, and will
			automatically and visibly be given credit for their contribution.
			This can be a great way to help community resources continue to grow
			and improve. It can also be a great way to learn!
		</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Does this all mean you’re opposed to paid commissions?</dt>

	<dd>
		<p>
			Not at all! We're well aware of the amount of time, thought, energy,
			and heart that goes into writing code for others and we absolutely
			believe that folks should be compensated for their work. We are
			fortunate enough to be in a position where we are able to provide
			resources for free, and we believe doing so actually benefits those
			who offer paid commissions. We believe the transparency into the
			process that we can offer here can help non-code savvy folks see
			just how much work all of this actually is, as well as recognize
			well-written code when they see it and better appreciate the value
			of it.
		</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>
		Would you consider taking payment instead to keep a commission closed
		source? Or only making part of it open source?
	</dt>

	<dd>
		<p>
			No, sorry. Magrathea is meant to benefit our community as much as
			possible, and doing either of those things limits the potential
			benefits that could be provided. There are lots of coders out there
			that will take on commissions under those kind of terms though!
		</p>
