	<p>
		We're updating this site in the open. Thanks for your patience while we
		remodel!
	</p>

	<p>
		Curious to watch the progress in detail? You can view and follow along

<h2>What is Magrathea?</h2>

<p>
	<b>Play-by-post roleplaying (RP) sites are about writing.</b>
	And, tangentially, they’re about code. RP sites can function just fine with
	the default code hosts provide, but we want these spaces to feel welcoming
	and homey, thematic and inspiring, we want them to be places we’re eager to
	cozy up in, sometimes as often as daily. But we’re writers, first and
	foremost, and these are writing spaces. How can we get what we seek out of
	code and also keep it out of the way as much as possible so we can focus on
	what we’re really here to do?
</p>

<p>
	Magrathea is meant to be one possible answer to that question. It’s a
	collection of resources, and an offer of help. It’s an effort to make
	creating, maintaining, and participating in RP sites easier and more
	accessible. It’s a way to give back to our very unique and special
	community. And it won’t cost you any money.
</p>

<h2>What Does Magrathea Offer?</h2>

<p>
	So what does Magrathea offer? Broadly speaking, free, high quality, open
	source code. But that’s an extremely brief way to say a whole lot, so let’s
	break it down.
</p>

<h3>Free And Open Source</h3>

<p>
	The resources provided through Magrathea don't cost you any money. There are
	some terms you'll need to follow, but Magrathea’s publicly available
	projects exclusively fall under open source licenses, whose terms are meant
	to be straightforward and to benefit creators and communities. In fact,
	<strong
		>the terms of most Magrathea projects are as simple as providing
		credit</strong
	>. You can get full details for any specific Magrathea project from its
	associated license file.
</p>

	<h4>What is "open source?"</h4>

	<p>
		If you've never heard of "open source" before, GitHub provides a few
		helpful resources. Their "Open Source Guides" offer a
		<a
			href="https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/#what-does-open-source-mean"
			>definition of "open source"</a
		>
		and the "Choose a License" site contains a high-level
		<a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/"
			>summary of popular open source licenses</a
		>.
	</p>
</aside>

<h3>High Quality Code</h3>

<p>
	"High quality code" here means code that tries its darnedest to be both
	<i>approachable</i> and <i>accessible</i>.
</p>

<h4>What is Approachable Code?</h4>

<div>
	<p>Approachable code is code that is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Readable</b>, favoring clarity over concision by, for example,
			avoiding acronyms and shorthand
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Organized</b> in a considered and consistent way that includes
			clear names and structure
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Well-documented</b> inline where possible and with supplemental
			documentation as needed
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Easily maintained</b>. Someone trying to fix a bug or make an
			update in the code should be able to understand the ripple effects
			of doing so
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Built on modern standards</b>, and so is free of outdated,
			deprecated, or obsolete ways of doing things
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Something others can learn from</b> or make use of in ways that
			jumpstart or simplify their own efforts
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h4>What is Accessible Code?</h4>

<div>
	<p>
		Anybody who wants to write should be able to participate in our
		community regardless of the ways they need or want to approach our
		sites. From a coding standpoint, that kind of inclusivity doesn’t just
		magically happen, it’s something we need to actively think about and
		support. When we write code, we have the power and responsibility to
		respect the myriad ways that people choose to or must use technology.
		That, for a few non-exhaustive examples, means coding for people who:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Use screen readers or other assistive devices</li>
		<li>Use the keyboard to navigate a site</li>
		<li>Use touchscreen devices</li>
		<li>Are negatively affected by excess motion</li>
		<li>Modify their browser's default font size</li>
		<li>Swap out their browser's default font</li>
		<li>Zoom in on sites</li>
		<li>Have difficulty differentiating between colors</li>
		<li>Have sun shining on and washing out their screen</li>
		<li>Lower their screen's brightness, or shift its colors</li>
		<li>Become lost within or between pages</li>
		<li>Have difficulty interacting with small targets</li>
		<li>Have slower or lower bandwidth internet connections</li>
		<li>Use devices whose screens are different sizes or resolutions</li>
		<li>
			Want to or prefer to use languages other than English, which may be
			written in different directions
		</li>
		<li>
			Have accessibility needs or desires that change over time or in
			specific contexts (which is <em>all</em> of us!)
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>

		<a href="https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org"
			>Inclusive Design Principles</a
		>.)
	</p>
</div>

<p>
	The code provided through Magrathea likely won't be perfectly accessible
	always, but we want it to be! We're committed to doing the best we can and
	learning from our shortcomings (so please do reach out if you see something
	that could be better!).
</p>

<hr />

<p>
	Writing code that’s approachable and accessible isn’t always easy, but if we
	keep it in mind upfront and throughout the process, we can hopefully remove
	a lot of friction for a lot of folks on a lot of fronts.
</p>

<h2>What Resources Are Currently Available?</h2>

<p>
	All available Magrathea codes live as
	<a href="https://github.com/magratheaguide/"
		>repositories on GitHub under the Magrathea organization</a
	>. Only a few callouts will be featured here.
</p>

	If you’re not familiar with GitHub, there are a lot of great learning
	resources out there, including

	<h3>Vogsphere</h3>

	<p>The Claim Code Generator</p>
</hgroup>

<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/magratheaguide/vogsphere">Vogsphere</a>
	is a tool that enables you to create a claims form on your site. Instead of
	editing code, your members can just fill out that form to generate exactly
	what they need to post to make their claims. No more code typos for you to
	deal with, no more trying to sift through code for them. Win-win.
