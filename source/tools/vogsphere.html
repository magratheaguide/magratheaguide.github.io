<p>The Claim Code Generator</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/magratheaguide/vogsphere">Vogsphere</a>
	is a tool that enables you to create a claims form on your site. Instead of
	editing code, your members can just fill out that form to generate exactly
	what they need to post to make their claims. No more code typos for you to
	deal with, no more trying to sift through code for them. Win-win.
