A form you can fill out from within your browser to send and edit messages on Discord via webhook. This can be helpful in informational channels where server staff can all send and edit messages shown under a shared display name.

**Be careful!** Webhook URLs essentially contain a password within in the URL. _Anybody_ who has the URL can send messages to the channel, even if their own account isn't in the server.
