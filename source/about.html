<p>
	I’m <code>thewildmage</code>. You might know me better by my name, Cecilia,
	or my writing alias, Daine. I use she/her pronouns.
</p>

<p>
	I’m a software engineer. I have a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and
	Computer Science. I have professional experience as both a software quality
	assurance engineer and a database engineer. And I&#39;ve made a hobby of
	front-end web development, where I advocate strongly for accessibility,
	inclusivity, usability, and open source.
</p>

<p>
	I created Magrathea because I believe that collaboration can be magical. If
	you’ve participated in the play-by-post roleplaying community before, you
	may agree. But you’ve also likely come up against barriers to accessibility,
	inclusivity, and usability because such barriers are, sadly, rampant in this
	space. This hobby is something special and unique, and I hate to see it
	dampened. Magrathea is my way of doing something about that.
